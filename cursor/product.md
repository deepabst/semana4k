# Semana4K – Product Overview

Semana4K visualizes a human life as a finite set of weeks.

Each week is a small square in a grid.
Together, they form a complete lifespan.

Users overlay meaningful periods of their life onto this grid:

- Education
- Work
- Relationships
- Personal events

The app is intentionally minimal.
It is a reflection tool, not a productivity tool.
